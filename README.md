## Preprocessor Logos

A collection of single-colour, vector preprocessor logos, a la [Browser Logos](https://github.com/alrra/browser-logos).

At [Chloi Inc.](http://chloi.io), we work with preprocessors pretty frequently. We even built a static web server with some of the best preprocessors build in: [it’s called Harp](http://github.com/sintaxi/harp). This repo contains the logos we collected along the way and more, with the help of some awesome [contributors](https://github.com/chloi/preprocessor-logos/graphs/contributors). We hope it’s helpful.
